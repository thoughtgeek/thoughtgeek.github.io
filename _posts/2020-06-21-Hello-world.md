I have been thinking of starting a blog to jot down all my thoughts in one place and finally I got the time to start this blog. After a very long deliberation with myself about what blogging framework to use, I finally concluded that `Jekyll + Github Pages` is the best way to start with this journey.

Hope the articles that I write on this blog would be useful to fellow developers and I can be a useful drop in the ocean of the internet.

Thanks for being here. Happy coding!
